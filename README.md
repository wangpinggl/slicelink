- This repository is a pytorch implementation of the Self-Supervised Learning of Contextual Embeddings for knowledge graph proposed in our WWW 2021 paper:
[Self-Supervised Learning of Contextual Embeddings for Link Prediction in Heterogeneous Networks](https://people.cs.vt.edu/~reddy/papers/WWW21.pdf). 

- More details about the implementation and codes will be updated soon!
